      Let's try without quotes:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Donal Trump's exact words were "You're fired"!
    </p>
    <h3>
      Now with Inline Quotes:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Donald Trump's exact words were <q>You're fired</q>!
    </p>
    <p>
      This method is best due to being able to format quoted text with CSS.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Now let's try multi line quotes:
    </h3>
    "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that was made all the difference."
    <h3>
      That did not work so well did it?
    </h3>
      <q>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
        I took the one less traveled by,
        And that was made all the difference.
      </q>
    <h3>
      Now let's try it with a Block Quote:
    </h3>
      <blockquote>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
        I took the one less traveled by,
        And that was made all the difference.
      </blockquote>
    <h3>
      That still did not work.  Let's try it using the Break Tag:
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I <br/>
      I took the one less traveled by, <br/>
      And that was made all the difference. <br/>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>
      The Break Tag is used to add a linebreak.
    </h3>
